# 🏠 Machine Learning-Based Forecasting of Residential Property Prices in Mumbai

This project aims to predict house prices in Mumbai using various supervised machine learning algorithms. It compares the performance of different models to identify the most accurate one based on evaluation metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R² Score.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains real estate listings from Mumbai and includes the following features:

- Region
- Area (in sq. ft.)
- Number of Bedrooms (BHK)
- Type 
- Price (target variable)

### 📌 Dataset Source:
> [D. Vaishnav, Mumbai House Prices, Kaggle, 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dravidvaishnav/mumbai-house-prices)  


## 🛠️ Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used for data processing, modeling, and evaluation:

- `pandas` – Data manipulation
- `numpy` – Numerical operations
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization
- `scikit-learn` – ML models & metrics
- `xgboost` – Extreme Gradient Boosting model

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**

These metrics help compare model performance and determine the best predictor.
